Ass – 8         Google Dorking


🔍 What is Google Dorking?
Google Dorking (also known as Google Hacking) is a technique that uses advanced Google search operators to find sensitive information that is publicly available on the internet, but not easily found with normal search queries.
It’s often used in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and threat intelligence to uncover misconfigured servers, exposed login portals, sensitive files, or metadata leaks.

✅ Simple Explanation:
Imagine Google as a very smart detective. Normally, people just ask it simple questions. But with Google Dorking, you give it very precise instructions—like:
“Show me Excel files on this government site with passwords in them.”
This is done using special search commands like filetype:, inurl:, intitle:, etc.

🛠️ Common Google Dork Operators:
Operator	Description
site:	Limits search to a specific site. 
Example: site:gov.in
filetype:	Looks for specific file types. 
Example: filetype:pdf
inurl:	Searches for keywords in the URL. 
Example: inurl:admin
intitle:	Searches for keywords in the page title. 
Example: intitle:index of
cache:	Shows Google’s cached version of a site.
intext:	Searches for specific words in page content.

🔒 Examples of Google Dorking
1.	Find login pages:
inurl:login site:edu.in
2.	Find exposed Excel files:
filetype:xls intext:"password"
3.	Discover security cameras:
inurl:"/view.shtml"
4.	Search for database dumps:
intitle:"index of" "db.sql"
5.	Find publicly exposed WordPress admin pages:
inurl:wp-admin site:.org
⚠️ These queries search for public data. Don’t try to log in or exploit — that’s illegal. Just observe what's exposed and report it ethically if necessary.

🧠 Why Is Google Dorking Useful in Cybersecurity?
•	Footprinting: Gathering open-source intel about a target.
•	Identifying Vulnerabilities: Finding misconfigured or forgotten endpoints.
•	Threat Intelligence: Knowing what’s exposed can help organizations secure it.
•	Reconnaissance: Part of the early stages of ethical hacking or penetration testing.

🧪 How to Do Your Assignment (Safely and Legally)
🔹 Objective:
Use tools like Google Dorking or Shodan to gather information about a target (within legal and ethical limits).
🔹 Steps to Follow:
✅ Step 1: Choose a public and legal target
Pick a public organization website or your own college website (e.g., site:abcuniversity.ac.in) for ethical practice.
✅ Step 2: Use Google Dorks like:
site:abcuniversity.ac.in filetype:pdf
site:abcuniversity.ac.in inurl:admin
site:abcuniversity.ac.in intitle:"index of"
✅ Step 3: Document what you find
For each dork:
•	Mention the dork used
•	Paste a screenshot or URL of your findings
•	Describe briefly what the page shows (e.g., login portal, exposed directory)
✅ Step 4: Mention ethical note
State clearly:
•	You did not access or misuse any restricted area
•	This is public info
•	The goal was educational

📄 Sample Report Snippet
🔍 Google Dork Used:
inurl:admin site:abcuniversity.ac.in

🔗 Result:
https://abcuniversity.ac.in/admin/login

📝 Description:
This shows an admin login portal of the university website.

🔐 Ethical Note:
Only public pages were visited. No login attempts or exploitation was done. This is for cybersecurity learning only.

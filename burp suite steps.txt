How to Operate Web Application 
Vulnerability Scanner: Burp Suite

1. Installation & Setup

• Download Burp Suite:
– Visit the PortSwigger website and download Burp Suite (Community, Professional, or 
Enterprise edition).
• Install Burp Suite:
– Follow the installation process for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
• Launch Burp Suite:
– Open Burp Suite and select:
• Temporary Project (for one-time use).
• New Project (for saving workspaces).
– Choose Use Burp Defaults for a quick start.

2 Configuring Proxy Settings

• Set Up Burp Proxy:
– Go to Proxy → Options and ensure the default listener is on 127.0.0.1:8080.
• Configure Browser Proxy:
– Set your browser's proxy settings to:
• IP Address: 127.0.0.1
• Port: 8080
– You can also use Burp’s embedded browser for easier configuration.
Install Burp’s CA Certificate (for HTTPS interception):
– Visit http://burpsuite in your proxy-configured browser.
– Download and install the CA Certificate in your browser’s trusted root section.


 3. Intercepting and Analyzing Web Traffic

• Enable Intercept Mode:
– Go to Proxy → Intercept and click Intercept is on to capture HTTP/S requests.
• Capture and Modify Requests:
– Intercept and inspect traffic between your browser and the target.
– Modify headers, cookies, or parameters in real time.
• Forward Requests:
– Use Forward to send the request to the server or Drop to block it.

 4. Performing a Website Scan

• Target Configuration:
– Go to Target → Scope and add the domain you want to scan.
– This limits testing to in-scope URLs.
• Active Scan (Automated Testing – Paid Feature):
– Right-click on a request and select Do an Active Scan.
– Burp will search for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
• Passive Scan (Community Edition Available):
– Automatically analyzes traffic for vulnerabilities without interacting with the server.


Manual Testing Tools
• Intruder (Automate Attacks):
– Use for brute-force, fuzzing, and parameter testing.
– Set a target request and customize payloads (e.g., password lists).
• Repeater (Manual Request Testing):
– Send individual requests for manual analysis.
– Modify parameters and observe server responses.
• Decoder (Data Encoding & Decoding):
– Encode or decode values (e.g., Base64, URL encoding) during testing.
• Sequencer (Token Analysis):
– Analyze session randomness to identify weak session tokens.


 6. Generating Reports
• View Scan Results:
– Go to Dashboard or Issue Activity for a summary of detected 
vulnerabilities.
• Export Reports:
– Right-click on a target and select Generate HTML/XML Report for sharing 
findings.



7. Best Practices for Using Burp Suite
• Always define scope to avoid unauthorized scanning.
• Use Intercept only when needed to avoid disrupting traffic.
• Perform manual testing alongside automated scans for deeper 
insights.
• Update Burp Suite regularly for the latest vulnerability checks.
• Respect legal and ethical guidelines – always obtain 
permission before scanning.

🛡️ What is Chkrootkit?
Chkrootkit (short for Check Rootkit) is a free and open-source anti-rootkit tool for Unix-based systems like Linux. It’s used to detect signs of rootkits, which are malicious tools that hackers use to gain unauthorized control over a system.

It helps system administrators or digital forensic analysts to identify hidden malware or compromised system binaries.

🧠 In Simple Words:
Imagine your system is your house. A rootkit is like a hidden intruder who sneaks in, hides behind the walls, and controls your house without your knowledge.
Now, Chkrootkit is like a sniffer dog that checks your house for any signs of those hidden intruders.

🔍 What Does It Check?
Chkrootkit scans your system for:

Check Type	Purpose
Infected binaries	Looks at commands like ps, ls, netstat, and checks if they've been altered
Hidden network connections	Detects suspicious network ports or services
Login anomalies	Identifies unexpected or invisible user logins
Process hiding	Spots processes that are running but hidden from the system monitor
Rootkit signatures	Detects known rootkits using a predefined list

🧪 How to Use Chkrootkit (for Assignment)
🖥️ This tool is used on Linux. If you’re on Windows, you can either:

Use a virtual machine (VM) with Ubuntu or Kali Linux

Or boot into a Linux live environment

✅ Step-by-Step for Assignment:
1. 🔧 Install Chkrootkit
Open your terminal in a Linux system and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install chkrootkit
2. 🚨 Run a Rootkit Scan
To scan your system:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo chkrootkit
This will display output for each check, like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Checking `ifconfig'... not infected
Checking `login'... not infected
Checking `ls'... not infected
If it finds anything suspicious, it will say "INFECTED".

3. 🔍 Optional: Simulate Rootkit (Only for advanced testing)
For learning purposes only, you can download test files or check sample logs that mimic rootkit behavior. Do not install real rootkits unless on a secure, isolated test environment.

4. 🧽 Explore Anti-Forensics Role
Explain how Chkrootkit can be used in a forensic investigation to detect tampering, and how an attacker might try to bypass it (e.g., by replacing system binaries, using LD_PRELOAD tricks, etc.).

🔧 Tool Studied: Chkrootkit

📌 Objective:
To analyze the system for rootkits and hidden malicious processes or modified binaries.

🧪 Test Performed:
- Installed and ran `chkrootkit` on Ubuntu system.
- Examined outputs for common binaries (`ls`, `ps`, `netstat`, etc.)

📝 Observations:
- All checks returned “not infected”
- No hidden processes or malicious logins detected

🔐 Anti-Forensic Insight:
While chkrootkit helps investigators detect rootkits, sophisticated attackers can install custom rootkits that avoid detection. However, it remains a powerful first-line tool in forensic analysis.

⚠️ Note: The tool was used in a safe, legal, and educational Linux environment.

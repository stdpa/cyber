Ass 9 - CCleaner

🧽 What is CCleaner?
CCleaner is a popular system optimization and privacy cleaning tool developed by Piriform. It helps users clean junk files, erase digital footprints, and optimize their system performance.
It’s often used in anti-forensics to remove digital traces (logs, histories, temp files) that could otherwise be used to investigate or reconstruct user activity.

🧠 In Simple Words:
Think of CCleaner as a digital eraser. It wipes out the evidence of your actions on a computer — like:
•	Web history
•	Recently opened files
•	Cache and cookies
•	Temporary system files
•	Application usage logs
So, if someone were trying to track what you did on the system, they would find very little if CCleaner had cleaned it up.

🔍 Key Features Relevant to Anti-Forensics:
Feature	Purpose
Cleaner	Removes browser cache, cookies, and history. Cleans system temp files, clipboard data, recent documents, etc.
Registry Cleaner	Deletes unused or broken Windows registry entries (not very forensic-focused, but useful for stealth).
Drive Wiper	Overwrites free disk space to ensure deleted files can’t be recovered (very important for anti-forensics).
Uninstall/Startup Manager	Helps remove software and manage what runs on boot (can remove forensic tools).
Scheduled Cleaning	Can be set to run automatically to ensure consistent trace removal.

🔐 Anti-Forensics Use Case (Within Legal Context):
Action	CCleaner Feature
Remove web browsing traces	Browser Cleaner
Delete temp files that store activity	System Cleaner
Prevent recovery of deleted files	Drive Wiper (with secure erase method)
Remove app usage traces (like MRU – Most Recently Used)	Application Cleaner
NOTE: Using CCleaner to hide malicious or unauthorized activities is illegal. It’s okay to use it for privacy and learning purposes, not for tampering with digital evidence.

✅ Step-by-Step for Assignment:
1. Install and Open CCleaner
•	Download from https://www.ccleaner.com
•	Install it on a test (non-critical) system.
2. Explore Key Modules:
•	Go to the Custom Clean tab — run a scan and note what it finds (browser history, system files, etc.).
